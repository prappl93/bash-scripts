# bash-scripts
Repository of bash scripts that I have created while attending college on a Slackware Linux server.

I have decided that instead of using scp to acquire these files on Linux-based operating systems, I would create a github repository for the sake of convenience for myself, or anyone else who may or may not want to utilize these scripts.

I have not maintained the scripts recently, and would like to take a moment to apologize to anyone who may be looking through any of the ones that are uploaded that may be looking for suggestions, as there probably isn't much documentation in these scripts (other than a preamble with details as to what the script is -intended- to do along with date last modified by myself.
